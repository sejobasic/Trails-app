# ⛰️ TRAILS - ADVENTURE AWAITS ⛰️

### Trails is a group project by Jerry Tong & Sejo Basic. Trails was created during a 1-week Group Project sprint at Flatiron School. Trails is built with a React Front-end and Rails Back-end for Auth
### As Avid Hikers ourselves we wanted to create an application that would make finding new hiking spots and trails easier and connect with other hikers. 

#### The user has the ability to see trails, add trails to their favorites list and also leave a review comment on a specific trail. Created UI elements using React, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS that automatically render when new backend data is populated. Managed encrypted data using Ruby, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord, and Bcrypt password hashing algorithm. Developed functionalities for users to favorite and write reviews on trails and receive recommendations based on rating/popularity.
